            <p class="post-description">Kafka was originally developed at LinkedIn in 2011 and has improved a lot since then. Nowadays it is a whole platform, allowing you to redundantly store absurd amounts of data, have a message bus with huge throughput (millions/sec) and use real-time stream processing on the data that goes through it all at once.</p>

                Since HTML is a tag-based language, it’s no surprise that at the core of HTML is the HTML tag. Let’s look at the syntax of an HTML tag.</p>

            <p class="post-description">HTML Semantic Elements
                First things first. What does the word semantic mean?se•man•tic - Relating to meaning in language or logic
                In other words, to call something semantic implies that the name conveys some inherent meaning.
                For example, if someone’s name is Raju, that doesn’t tell us much about him. But if we call him Flies Like The Wind, chances are he is a fast rider (of horses/cars/planes). Weeeeee! LOL.</p>
